## Description

***

{{< hl >}}...the formulas in range B14 to N27 arenâ€™t reading properly...{{< /hl >}}
<br />

2. Correct the formula(s) in the Weekly section in the Executive Overview to ensure proper output.  

## Solution

***

Update the date cell referenced in each formula. For example, C14 in **Executive Overview**:  
<br />

Change:
```swift
=SUMIFS('Raw Data Combined'!D:D,'Raw Data Combined'!$A:$A,">="&$A14-6,'Raw Data Combined'!$A:$A,"<="&$A14,'Raw Data Combined'!$I:$I,"<>#N/A")
```
To:
```swift
=SUMIFS('Raw Data Combined'!D:D,'Raw Data Combined'!$A:$A,">="&$B14-6,'Raw Data Combined'!$A:$A,"<="&$B14,'Raw Data Combined'!$I:$I,"<>#N/A")
```

## Explanation

***

Looking at the syntax again:

```swift
SUMIFS(sum_range, criteria_range1, criterion1, [criteria_range2, criterion2, ...])
```
1. sum_range - The range to be summed. 
2. criteria_range1 - The range to check against criterion1.
3. criterion1 - The pattern or test to apply to criteria_range1.
4. criteria_range2, criterion2, ... - [ OPTIONAL ] - Additional ranges and criteria to check.

The two remaining `SUMIFS()` arguments to review are `criterion1` and `criterion2`. From our formula, we see `criterion1= ">="&$A14-6` and `criterion2= "<="&$A14`. Given the desired formula output is bound by a date range (weekly) for each row, it makes sense that these criterion should reference dates.

In plain terms, `criterion1= ">="&$A14-6` tells the formula to ignore rows with a date before the date six days prior to the value referenced in cell A14 of the  **Executive Overview** sheet. Similarly, `criterion2= "<="&$A14` tells the formula to ignore rows with a date after the date referenced in cell A14.  

An undesired consequence of {{< hl >}}copying the formulas over [from **Weekly Overview**] and dragging them across{{< /hl >}}, all the formulas incorrectly reference date values from cells in column A. Unlike in **Weekly Overview**, the dates in **Executive Overview** are in column B, not A. As in the example above, to correct the reference we simply change `A` to `B` everywhere the formulas reference the date.

Of course, we'll need to do this for all formulas in the table, not just cell C14. Rather than change each cell manually, we can use **Find & Replace** to do it much quicker.

Below we can see the correct date cell references being used in the table formulas. Unfortunately, we're still not seeing any values. It seems there must be another issue.
