## Task 2

***

### Prompt

A fellow account manager has been working on their weekly report for a client, but can’t quite seem to get it working. The individual sheets work, but the Weekly section in the Executive Overview isn’t pulling in any data, even though they copied the formulas over and dragged them across. It looks like the formulas in range B14 to N27 aren’t reading properly, but the dates in Column B look different too. Once you’re able to figure that out, the data needs to match the Weekly sheet, and there should be 15 weeks shown. Please help, and explain your findings. 

### Bonus

They really want to use periods to show the dates, maybe there’s a way to make it work? 

### File Link

Here is their report (File > Make A Copy):
